## Problem brief ##
###################

A website displays two decimal integers between 8 and 12 places long.
The Greatest Common Multiple of the two numbers must be submitted back 
to the website.

###################
## Problem notes ##
###################

A message stating that the response was too slow is issued to a cut 
and paste response using a pre-existing tool (Circia 6 seconds.)
A message stating that the response was too slow is issued to a 
re-written response using a pre-existing tool (Circia 10 seconds,
focus stays on the form window.)
A message stating that the response was too slow is issued to a 
response that takes 40 seconds. (Acceptable pen and paper calculation time.)
Packet capture shows that the numbers are embedded in the page rather than 
fetched asynchronously.


##############
## Solution ##
##############

Write a progarm that will:
- Fetch two prime numbers from a website
- Calculate the GCD
- Submit it to the website

#####################
## Language choice ##
#####################

Javascript is the right language for this particular task as it contains all the 
needed tools: AJAX, numerical processing, leverage of the browser for rendering response.

However this is a test of Java and/or Python coding skills.
